      I grew up in southern Illinois playing a lot of video games. I was
      introduced to Counter Strike and PC gaming by one my foreign exchange
      student brother while I was in middle school. I kept this interest for years to come and as
      games increased their graphics and demand for computing power, I could no
      longer use my mom's work laptop to play my favorite FPS games. After many
      YouTube videos and earning some money by working for my dad's taxidermy
      shop, I bought a PC from BestBuy and an Nvidia 550 EVGA graphics card.
      This sparked my interest in computers and kicked-started my technology
      adventure. Soon after, I was soon fixing computers and smartphones for locals. When
      college approached and I had to focus on a degree, I decided I was done
      with hardware and wanted to learn how to build software. Four and a half
      years later, I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science with four
      internships under my belt.
